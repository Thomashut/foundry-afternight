# foundry-afternight
An experimental Foundry-vtt module for my homebrew TTRPG system Afternight. A character/narrative focused system all about your character's knowledge and how they use it to survive in the new world. This is an in development module and system. So expect changes and imbalance left right and centre as I tweak things.
